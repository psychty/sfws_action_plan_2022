# Smoke Free West Sussex Action Plan 2022 Update

This is the updated action plan for the SmokeFree West Sussex Partnership.

These are a collection of actions agreed by members of the Smokefree West Sussex Partnership to take forward the tobacco control agenda in the county. Actions are coloured by the Department of Health's 2008 10 high impact changes to achieve tobacco control.

~~You can filter the actions by the time frame (short to long term) or by the level at which the action is expected to operate within (individual/community/or place). To learn more about an action, click on the box. You can also search for keywords such as 'e-cigarettes' or 'maternity' to find relevant actions.~~

~~The 2019-22 Smokefree West Sussex Tobacco Control Strategy document can be found~~

This will have improved functionality over the previous iteration, and will complement the updated Tobacco Control Strategy document found here (insert link tbc)
