            <p className="highlight">A new national strategy is expected in 2023, at which time a new full West Sussex strategy and action plan will be developed. In the interim, the West Sussex Smokefree Partnership have developed a one year strategy extension, which takes into account the current local position and relevant additional elements of the recent Khan ‘Making Smoking Obsolete’ independent report.</p>
