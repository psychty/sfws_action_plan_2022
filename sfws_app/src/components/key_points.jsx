            <p>Smoking remains the single biggest preventable cause of death and ill health in England. The Smokefree West Sussex Partnership is a group of partners in organisations across West Sussex working together to provide strategic direction and leadership on the tobacco control agenda in West Sussex.</p>

            <p>In 2019, the West Sussex Tobacco Control Strategy and Action Plan (a collection of actions agreed by members of the Smokefree West Sussex Partnership to take forward the tobacco control agenda in the county) was launched and this is due to finish this year.</p>

            <p className="highlight">A new national strategy is expected in 2023, at which time a new full West Sussex strategy and action plan will be developed. In the interim, the West Sussex Smokefree Partnership have developed a one year strategy extension, which takes into account the current local position and relevant additional elements of the recent Khan ‘Making Smoking Obsolete’ independent report.</p>
